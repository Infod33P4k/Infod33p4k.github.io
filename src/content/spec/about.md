I’m a cybersecurity professional with a strong passion for ethical hacking, red teaming, and vulnerability research. My experience spans across vulnerability assessments, digital infrastructure hardening, and the development of automation tools for reconnaissance and offensive testing.

I hold a **Certified Penetration Tester (CPT)** certification from the **Red Team Hacker Academy** and am currently pursuing the **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** certification from **Hack The Box**, demonstrating my commitment to mastering advanced techniques and methodologies used by modern adversaries.

My educational foundation includes the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, and I consistently engage in hands-on learning platforms. Notably, I’ve achieved a **Top 2% global ranking on TryHackMe**, reflecting my drive to stay sharp in the fast-evolving threat landscape.

I believe in the power of open knowledge, collaborative security research, and ethical innovation to build a safer digital future. Whether I’m reverse engineering obfuscated payloads, exploiting business logic flaws, or automating post-exploitation chains, I’m fueled by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact.
