# 🧑‍💻 About

This is the personal site of [Deepak S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d3p4k/) — a cybersecurity enthusiast and penetration tester committed to securing the digital world through continuous learning and real-world application.

I’m a **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** from **Hack The Box** and hold the **Certified Penetration Tester (CPT)** credential from **Red Team Hacker Academy**. My core expertise lies in **web application penetration testing**, **Active Directory exploitation**, and **red teaming** engagements simulating real-world adversaries.

Over the years, I’ve developed automation tools to streamline reconnaissance and offensive operations, performed vulnerability assessments, and contributed to infrastructure hardening across various environments.

I’ve consistently expanded my skills by solving CTF-style labs and real-world simulation boxes on platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and others. Currently, I am preparing for the **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** exam to deepen my expertise in advanced red teaming techniques.

Whether reverse engineering obfuscated payloads, exploiting complex business logic flaws, or automating multi-stage post-exploitation, I’m driven by curiosity and a mission to make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity landscape.
